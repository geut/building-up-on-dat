# Usage
<!-- usage -->
There are 2 things that you should do before start using gpm as your funny package manager.

First is to run your own registry, so, on one machine you should run

```sh-session
$ gpm registry
```
That will create a registry and start the registry endpoint on the current directory. **You run this only once**

The other task that _everyone_ should run is the daemon. Looks like this:

```sh-session
$ gpm daemon
```
This will sync with the registry and keep seeding your local copy of it.

_NOTE: before run the daemon be sure to set it up with the public key provided by the registry command. Take a look to the `conf` command_

Boom :boom: ! You are ready to run your publish (`newdep`) or installs. :cool:
